# Data Generation And Visualisation
>This is university homework taken to an extreme. 
---
What Was asked of us is to explore some of the reasons people dropout.
First step is to ask the questions that could lead 
us to knowing some of the factors and then fill up a dataset manually 
and visualize said dataset. <br>
I thought it was silly to ask us to fill it up manually and so i spend an entire day
setting up `genQuestionnaireDataset.ipynb` so I could have it create a dataset of 17k rows
<br>Let me be clear, <mark> the dataset is in no way perfect </mark> but it does the job for now.

## Tips
If you want to create a new dataset of random users using the api you'll need to sign up at [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/Alejandro99aru/api/random-user/) and subscribe to the API for **Free**
and get your own api key
